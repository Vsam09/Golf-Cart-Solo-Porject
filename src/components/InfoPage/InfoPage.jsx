          The toughest 
          <br/>challenge I 
          <br/>overcame was 
          <br/>synchronizing all the 
          <br/>users items list so they 
          <br/>can have the ability to edit 
          <br/>and delete .

      </ul>
      <h2>What's Next</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Now that users can buy and sell their 
          <br/>equipments, the next challenge Iâ€™d love to tackle is 
          <br/>ability to add golfing accessories. Not only can user buy 
          <br/>and sell golf clubs, they can also purchase all necessary 
          <br/>items to start golfing. 
        </li>
